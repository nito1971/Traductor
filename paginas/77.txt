what men shall die? It may be, that in the sight of Heaven, you 
are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor

Scrooge bent before the Ghost’s rebuke, and trembling cast his 
eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on hearing 
his own name.  
“Mr. Scrooge!” said Bob; “I’ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder 
of the Feast!”  
“The Founder of the Feast indeed!” cried Mrs. Cratchit, 
reddening. “I wish I had him here. I’d give him a piece of my 
mind to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for 
it.” 
“My dear,” said Bob, “the children! Christmas Day.”  
“It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,” said she, “on which one 
drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man 
as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better 
than you do, poor fellow!”  
“My dear,” was Bob’s mild answer, “Christmas Day.”  
“I’ll drink his health for your sake and the Day’s,” said Mrs. 
Cratchit, “not for his. Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a 
happy new year! He’ll be very merry and very happy, I ha ve no 
doubt!”
