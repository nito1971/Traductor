“Because you fell in love!” growled Scrooge, as if that were the 
only one thing in the wor ld more ridiculous than a merry 
Christmas. “Good afternoon!”  
“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that 
happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?”  
“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.  
“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why ca nnot we 
be friends?”  
“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.  
“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have 
never had any quarrel, to which I have been a party. But I have 
made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I’ll keep my 
Christmas humour t o the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!”  
“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge. “And A Happy New Year!”  
  
“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.  
His nephew left the room without an angry word, 
notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the 
greetings of the  season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was 
warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.  
“There’s another fellow,” muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: 
“my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, 
talking about a merry Christ mas. I’ll retire to Bedlam.”
