“You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings and all, with 
him lying there?” said Joe.  
“Yes I do,” replied the woman. “Why not?”  
“You were born to make your fortune,” said Joe, “and you’ll 
certainly do 
it.” 
“I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can get anything in it 
by reaching  
  
it out, for the sake of such a man as He was, I promise you, 
Joe,” returned the woman coolly. “Don’t drop that oil upon the 
blankets, now.”  
“His blankets?” asked Joe.  
“Whose else’s do you think?” replied the woman. “He isn’t likely 
to take cold without ’em, I dare say.”  
“I hope he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?” said old Joe, 
stopping in his work, and looking up.  
“Don’t you be afraid of that,” returned the woman. “I an’t so 
fond of his company that I’d loiter about him for such things, if 
he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache; 
but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the 
best he had, and a fine one too. They’d have wasted  it, if it 
hadn’t been for me.”
