The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who 
were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig: and when he 
had done so, said,  
“Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal

or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so 
slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and coun t 
’em up: what then? The happiness he gives, is quite as great as 
if it cost a fortune.”

or two to my clerk just now. That’s all.”

the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in 
the open air.  
“My time grows s hort,” observed the Spirit. “Quick!”
