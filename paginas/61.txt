believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange 
appearances, and that nothing between a bab y and rhinoceros 
would have astonished him very much.  
Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by any 
means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the Bell 
struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent 
fit of trembling. F ive minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour 
went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay upon his bed, the 
very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed 
upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being 
only light, was mo re alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was 
powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was 
sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment 
an interesting case of spontaneous combustion, without having 
the consolation of knowing it.  At last, however, he began to 
think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always 
the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to 
have been done in it, and would unquestionably have done it 
too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret 
of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from  
  
whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea 
taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled 
in his slippers to the door.
