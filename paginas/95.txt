The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant 
in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the 
only answer he received.  
Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge 
feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath 
him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared 
to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his 
condition, and giving him time to recover.

vague u ncertain horror, to know that behind the dusky shroud, 
there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, 
though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing 
but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.  
“Ghost of the Future!” he exclai med, “I fear you more than any 
spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me 
good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, 
I am prepared to bear you company, and do it with a thankful 
heart. Will you not speak to me?”

them.  
“Lead on!” said Scrooge. “Lead on! The night is waning fast, and 
it is precious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!”

he thought, and carried him along.
