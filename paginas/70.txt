Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of 
the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit’s 
dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch. Think of that! Bob had 
but fifteen “Bob” a -week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but 
fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of 
Christmas Present blessed his four - roomed house!  
Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Crat chit’s wife, dressed out but 
poorly in a twice -turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are 
cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the 
cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, 
also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork 
into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his 
monstrous shirt collar (Bob’s private property, conferred upon 
his son and heir in honour of the day) into his mouth, rejoiced to 
find himself so gallantly attired, and y earned to show his linen in 
the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and 
girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker’s they 
had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in 
luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, t hese young Cratchits 
danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to 
the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked 
him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up, knocked 
loudly at the saucepan -lid to be let out a nd peeled.  
“What has ever got your precious father then?” said Mrs. 
Cratchit. “And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha warn’t as late 
last Christmas Day by half - an-hour?”
