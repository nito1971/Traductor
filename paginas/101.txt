here’s a chance! If we haven’t all three met here without 
meaning it! ” 
“You couldn’t have met in a better place,” said old Joe, 
removing his pipe from his mouth. “Come into the parlour. You 
were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an’t 
strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! How it 
skreeks! T here an’t such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its 
own hinges, I believe; and I’m sure there’s no such old bones 
here, as mine. Ha, ha! We’re all suitable to our calling, we’re well 
matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.”  
The parlour w as the space behind the screen of rags. The old 
man raked the fire together with an old stair -rod, and having 
trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the stem of his 
pipe, put it in his mouth again.  
While he did this, the woman who had already spok en threw her 
bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a 
stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold 
defiance at the other two.  
“What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?” said the woman. 
“Every person has a right to tak e care of themselves. He always 
did.”  
“That’s true, indeed!” said the laundress. “No man more so.”  
“Why then, don’t stand staring as if you was afraid, woman; 
who’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick holes in each other’s 
coats, I suppose?”
