move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, 
whose depths were secrets as profound as  
  
Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, 
to hear a hearty laugh. It w as a much greater surprise to 
Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew’s and to find himself 
in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling 
by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving 
affability!  
“Ha, ha!” laughed Scroog e’s nephew. “Ha, ha, ha!”  
If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man 
more blest in a laugh than Scrooge’s nephew, all I can say is, I 
should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I’ll 
cultivate his acquaintance.  
It is a fair, even -handed, noble adjustment of things, that while 
there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the 
world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good -humour. 
When Scrooge’s nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, 
rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant 
contortions: Scrooge’s niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily 
as he. And their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand, 
roared out lustily.  
“Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!”
