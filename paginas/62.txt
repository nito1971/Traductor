The moment Scroog e’s hand was on the lock, a strange voice 
called him by his name, and bade him enter. He obeyed.  
It was his own room. There was no doubt about that. But it had 
undergone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling 
were so hung with living green, tha t it looked a perfect grove; 
from every part of which, bright gleaming berries glistened. The 
crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, 
as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a 
mighty blaze went roaring up  the chimney, as that dull 
petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge’s time, or 
Marley’s, or for many and many a winter season gone. Heaped 
up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, 
game, poultry, brawn, great joints of mea t, sucking -pigs, long 
wreaths of sausages, mince -pies, plum -puddings, barrels of 
oysters, red - hot chestnuts, cherry -cheeked apples, juicy 
oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth -cakes, and seething 
bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their del icious 
steam. In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, 
glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike 
Plenty’s horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on 
Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.  
“Come in!” exclaim ed the Ghost. “Come in! and know me better, 
man!”  
Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit. 
He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the 
Spirit’s eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.
