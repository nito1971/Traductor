“I don’t know what to do!” cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in 
the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with 
his stockings. “I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an 
angel, I am as  merry as a schoolboy. I am as giddy as a 
drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New 
Year to all the world. Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!”  
He had frisked into the sitting -room, and was now standing 
there: perfectly winded.  
“There’s the saucepan t hat the gruel was in!” cried Scrooge, 
starting off again, and going round the fireplace. “There’s the 
door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered! There’s the 
corner where the Ghost of Christmas Present, sat! There’s the 
window where I saw the wanderi ng Spirits! It’s all right, it’s all 
true, it all happened. Ha ha ha!”  
Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so many 
years, it was a  
  
splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, 
long line of brilliant laughs!  
“I don’t know  what day of the month it is!” said Scrooge. “I 
don’t know how long I’ve been among the Spirits. I don’t know 
anything. I’m quite a baby. Never mind. I don’t care. I’d rather 
be a baby. Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!”
