be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus  with what 
you show me!”  
The Spirit was immovable as ever.  
Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following 
the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own 
name, Ebenezer Scrooge.  
“Am I that man who lay upon the bed?” he cried, upon his 
knees. The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back 
again.  
“No, Spirit! Oh no, no!” The finger still was there.  
“Spirit!” he cried, tight clutching at its robe, “hear me! I am not 
the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for  
this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope!”  
For the first time the hand appeared to shake.  
“Good Spirit,” he pursued, as down upon the ground he fell 
before it: “Your nature intercedes for me, and pities me. Assure 
me that I yet may change  these shadows you have shown me, 
by an altered life!”  
The kind hand trembled.  
“I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the 
year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The 
Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I w ill not shut out the 
lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the 
writing on this stone!”
