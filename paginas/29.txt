Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on 
at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.  
“Hear me!” cried the Ghost. “My time is nearly gone.”  
“I will,” said Scrooge. “But don’t be  hard upon me! Don’t be 
flowery, Jacob! Pray!”  
“How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, 
I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a 
day.”  
It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the 
perspiration  from his brow.  
“That is no light part of my penance,” pursued the Ghost. “I am 
here to - night to warn you, that you have yet a chance and 
hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my procuring, 
Ebenezer.”  
“You were always a good friend to me,” said Scrooge. 
“Thank’ee!” “You will be haunted,” resumed the Ghost, “by Three 
Spirits.” Scrooge’s countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost’s 
had done.  
“Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?” he 
demanded , in a faltering voice.  
“It is.”  
“I—I think I’d rather not,” said Scrooge.
