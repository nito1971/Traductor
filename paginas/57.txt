wooden platter! The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! 
The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable 
alike. It is enough that by degrees the children and their 
emotions got out of the parlour, and by one stair  
  
at a time, up to the top of the house; where they went to bed, 
and so subsided.  
And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when 
the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on 
him, sat down with her  and her mother at his own fireside; and 
when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful 
and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a 
spring -time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very 
dim indeed.  
“Belle,” said the husband, turning to his wife with a smile, “I saw 
an old friend of yours this afternoon.”  
“Who was it?” “Guess!”  
“How can I? Tut, don’t I know?” she added in the same breath, 
laughing as he laughed. “Mr. Scrooge.”  
“Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was 
not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help 
seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and 
there he sat alone. Quite alone in the world, I do believe.”
