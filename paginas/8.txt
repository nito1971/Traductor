Wherefore the clerk pu t on his white comforter, and tried to 
warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man of 
a strong imagination, he failed.  
“A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!” cried a cheerful 
voice. It was the voice of Scrooge’s nephew, who came upon 
him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his 
approach.  
“Bah!” said Scrooge, “Humbug!”  
He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and 
frost, this nephew of Scrooge’s, that he was all in a glow; his 
face was ruddy and handsome; h is eyes sparkled, and his 
breath smoked again.  
“Christmas a humbug, uncle!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “You 
don’t mean that, I am sure?”  
“I do,” said Scrooge. “Merry Christmas! What right have you to 
be merry?  
What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor enou gh.” 
“Come, then,” returned the nephew gaily. “What right have you 
to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich 
enough.”  
Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the 
moment, said, “Bah!” again; and followed it up with “Humbug.”  
“Don’t be cross, uncle!” said the nephew.
