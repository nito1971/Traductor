There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a 
handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were 
far from being water -proof; their  
  
clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and  very 
likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker’s. But, they were happy, 
grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; 
and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright 
sprinklings of the Spirit’s torch at parting, Scrooge had his e ye 
upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.  
By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and 
as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness 
of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, 
was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed 
preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through 
and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be 
drawn to shut out cold and darkness. There all the children of 
the house were running out into the snow to meet their married 
sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet 
them. Here, again, were shadows on the window -blind of guests 
assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded 
and fur -booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to 
some near neighbour’s house; where, woe upon the single man 
who saw them enter  
—artful witches, well they knew it —in a glow!
