“What then?” he retorted. “Even if I have grown so much wiser, 
what then? I am not changed towards you.”  
She shook her head. “Am I?”  
“Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were both 
poor and  
  
content to be so, until, in good season, we could imp rove our 
worldly fortune by our patient industry. You are changed. When 
it was made, you were another man.”  
“I was a boy,” he said impatiently.  
“Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,” she 
returned. “I am. That which promised happiness when we were 
one in heart, is fraught with misery now that we are two. How 
often and how keenly I have thought of this, I will not say. It is 
enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.”  
“Have I ever sought release?” “In words. No. Never.”  
“In what, then?”  
“In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another 
atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything 
that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this 
had never been between us,” said the girl, looking mildly, bu t 
with steadiness, upon him; “tell me, would you seek me out and 
try to win me now? Ah, no!”
