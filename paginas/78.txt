The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their 
proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank it last of 
all, but he didn’t care twopence for it. Scrooge was the Ogre of 
the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the 
party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.  
After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than 
before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done 
with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye 
for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full five -and-
sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed 
tremendously at the idea of Peter’s being a man of business; 
and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between 
his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular 
investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of 
that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor apprentice at 
a milliner’s, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and 
how many hours she worked at a stretch, and how she meant to 
lie abed to -morrow morning for a good long rest; to -morrow 
being a holiday she passed at home. Also how she had seen a 
countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord “was 
much about as tall as Peter;” at which Peter pulled up his collars 
so high that you couldn’t have seen his head if you had been 
there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and 
round; and by -and-bye they had a song, about a lost child 
travelling in the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plai ntive little 
voice, and sang it very well indeed.
