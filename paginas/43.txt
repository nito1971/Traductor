“I wish,” Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and 
looking abou t him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: “but it’s 
too late now.”  
“What is the matter?” asked the Spirit.  
“Nothing,” said Scrooge. “Nothing. There was a boy singing a 
Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have 
given him something: that’s all.”  
The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it 
did so, “Let us see another Christma s!” 
Scrooge’s former self grew larger at the words, and the room 
became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the 
windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, 
and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was 
broug ht about, Scrooge knew no more than you do. He only 
knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened 
so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had 
gone home for the jolly holidays.  
He was not reading now, but walking up and do wn despairingly. 
Scrooge  
  
looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, 
glanced anxiously towards the door.
