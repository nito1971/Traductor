service to you in any way,’ he said, giving me his card, ‘that’s 
where I live. Pray come to me.’ Now, it w asn’t,” cried Bob, “for 
the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as 
for his kind way, that this was quite delightful. It really seemed 
as if he had known our Tiny Tim, and felt with us.”  
“I’m sure he’s a good soul!” said Mrs. Cratchit.  
“You would be surer of it, my dear,” returned Bob, “if you saw 
and spoke to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised —mark what I 
say!—if he got Peter a better situation.”  
“Only hear that, Peter,” said Mrs. Cratchit.  
“And then,” cried one of the girls, “Peter wi ll be keeping 
company with some one, and setting up for himself.”  
  
“Get along with you!” retorted Peter, grinning.  
“It’s just as likely as not,” said Bob, “one of these days; though 
there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and 
whenever we par t from one another, I am sure we shall none of 
us forget poor Tiny Tim —shall we—or this first parting that there 
was among us?”  
“Never, father!” cried they all.  
“And I know,” said Bob, “I know, my dears, that when we 
recollect how patient and how mild he w as; although he was a 
little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, 
and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it.”
