But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way 
to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was 
at home  to give them welcome when they got there, instead of 
every house expecting company, and piling up its fires half -
chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted! How it 
bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, 
and floated on, outpo uring, with a generous hand, its bright and 
harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very 
lamplighter, who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with 
specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening 
somewhere, laughed out loudly as the  Spirit passed, though 
little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but 
Christmas!  
And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood 
upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of 
rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial -place 
of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would 
have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing 
grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the 
west the setting sun had left a streak of fie ry red, which glared 
upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and 
frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of 
darkest night.  
“What place is this?” asked Scrooge.  
“A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of the  
earth,” returned the Spirit. “But they know me. See!”
