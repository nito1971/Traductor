“I don’t kno w,” said Scrooge. “Why do you doubt your senses?”  
“Because,” said Scrooge, “a little thing affects them. A slight 
disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an 
undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a 
fragment of an underd one potato. There’s more of gravy than 
of grave about you, whatever you are!”  
Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he 
feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then. The truth is, that 
he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own 
attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre’s voice 
disturbed the very marrow in his bones.  
To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence for a 
moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him. 
There was something very  awful,  
  
too, in the spectre’s being provided with an infernal atmosphere 
of its own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly 
the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, 
and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated a s by the hot vapour 
from an oven.  
“You see this toothpick?” said Scrooge, returning quickly to the 
charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it 
were only for a second, to divert the vision’s stony gaze from 
himself.
