“I don’t mind  going if a lunch is provided,” observed the 
gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. “But I must be fed,

the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, an d I never eat 
lunch. But I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to

friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, 
bye!”
