“He’s  in the dining -room, sir, along with mistress. I’ll show you 
up-stairs, if you please.”  
  
“Thank’ee. He knows me,” said Scrooge, with his hand already 
on the dining -room lock. “I’ll go in here, my dear.”  
He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They 
were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); 
for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such 
points, and like to see that everything is right.  
“Fred!” said Scroog e. 
Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge 
had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner 
with the footstool, or he wouldn’t have done it, on any account.  
“Why bless my soul!” cried Fred, “who’s that?”  
“It’s I. Your unc le Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let 
me in, Fred?”  
Let him in! It is a mercy he didn’t shake his arm off. He was at 
home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece 
looked just the same. So did Topper when he came. So did the 
plump sis ter when she came. So did every one when they came. 
Wonderful party,  wonderful games, wonderful unanimity, won -
der-ful happiness!
