“Why, it’s Ali Baba!” Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. “It’s dear old 
honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas time, when 
yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the 
first time, just like that.  Poor boy! And Valentine,” said Scrooge, 
“and his wild brother, Orson; there they go! And what’s his 
name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the Gate of 
Damascus; don’t you see him! And the Sultan’s Groom turned 
upside down by the Genii; there he  is upon his head! Serve him 
right. I’m glad of it. What business had he to be married to the 
Princess!”  
To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on 
such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing 
and crying; and to see his  heightened and excited face; would 
have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.  
“There’s the Parrot!” cried Scrooge. “Green body and yellow tail, 
with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; 
there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came 
home again after sailing round the island. ‘Poor Robin Crusoe, 
where have you been, Robin Crusoe?’ The man thought he was 
dreaming, but he wasn’t. It was the Parrot, you know. There 
goes Friday, running for his life to t he little creek! Halloa! Hoop! 
Halloo!”  
Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual 
character, he said, in pity for his former self, “Poor boy!” and 
cried again.
