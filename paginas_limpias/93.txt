Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of suc h enormous magnitude.  “Spirit! are they yours?” Scrooge could say no more.  “They are Man’s,” said the Spirit, looking down upon them. “And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all o f their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased. Deny it!” cried the Spirit, stretching out its hand towards the city. “Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious  purposes, and make it worse. And bide the end!”  “Have they no refuge or resource?” cried Scrooge.  “Are there no prisons?” said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words. “Are there no workhouses?”  The bell struck twelve.
