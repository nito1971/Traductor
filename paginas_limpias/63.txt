“I am the Ghost of C hristmas Present,” said the Spirit. “Look upon me!”  Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.  “You have never seen the like of me before!” exclaimed the Spirit. “Never,” Scrooge made answer to it.    “Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?” pursued the  Phantom.  “I don’t think I have,” said Scrooge. “I am afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?”  “More than eighteen hundred,” said the Ghost.  63
