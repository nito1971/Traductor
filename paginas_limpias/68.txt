was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love it, so it was!  In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker’s oven; where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.  “Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?” asked Scrooge.  “There is.
