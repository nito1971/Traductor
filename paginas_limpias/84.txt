“He said that Christmas was a humbug , as I live!” cried Scrooge’s nephew. “He believed it too!”  “More shame for him, Fred!” said Scrooge’s niece, indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest.  She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With  a dim pled, surprised - looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed —as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any li ttle creature’s head. Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory.  “He’s a comical old fellow,” said Scrooge’s nephew, “that’s the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.”  “I’m sure he is very rich, Fred,” hinted Scrooge’s niece. “At least you always tell me so.”  “What of that, my dear!” said Scrooge’s nephew. “His wealth is of no use to him. He  don’t do any good with it. He don’t make himself comfortable with it. He hasn’t the satisfaction of thinking —ha, ha, ha! —that he is ever going to benefit US with it.” 84
